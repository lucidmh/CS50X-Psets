sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: i decided to check this by sorted ones to check omega and i realized that it takes more than sort 2 and less than sort 3 and i realized that  its Ω(n)

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: i've checked sorted10000 and i realized that this is the fastest one and as you know merge sort omega is Ω(n log n)

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: again, i checke this one by the sorted ones like sort 1 & 2 and i realized that this ones omega is Ω(n^2) and this have the biggest real time.
