# CS50X Projects
#### Description:
## Intro:
Hello, let me introduce myself first.
i'm a young guy from other side of the world who decide to take cs50.
after a while i completed the course and i decide to share the psets here.

## Technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- C
- Python
- SQL
- FLASK
- and more...

## About CS50X:
It was a good course to take but...
it just works for those who ant to start the **Computer science** for the first time.
At all, it was a good experience.

## About psets:
Actually i think there's around 20 psets here from the begin till the end.
If i want to choose my favourite psets, maybe i'll go with **week 8 one** or **Fiftyville**
If you have any suggestion, i'll appreciate it if you tell me.

***Thanks for reading this :moai:***
